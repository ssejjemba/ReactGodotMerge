# Running the Loony Loops Game

Press the **run game** button in the bottom section to start the Loony loops Game.
This repository has been written to test a bridge between the godot application
and a react dynamic website.

It tests messaging between the two application and a bridge that can be used for more
advanced setups. This was motivated by a problem at work that required a synchronous communication
between the 3d application made in godot and exported to Javascript and a React application both
running in the browser.
